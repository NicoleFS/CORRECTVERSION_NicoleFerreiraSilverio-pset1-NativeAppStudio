Here you can find my code for the MrPotatoHead assignment from the Native App Studio course

My app starts with a naked MrPotatoHead and unchecked checkboxes. Upon checking the checkboxes, 
depending on which boxes will be checked, several features, such as eyes, a mouth, etc., can be
added to the naked MrPotatoHead. Upon unchecking the boxes, the features disappear. The body 
will remain visible, no matter what.
